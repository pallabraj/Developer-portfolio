            <p>
                And therein lies the irony of telecommuting. As much as remote workers like the increased freedom, lack
                of
                commute, and fewer interruptions, a practice chosen for better work-life balance can make it worse. A
                Center
                for Work and Family study found that only 24% of telecommuters rated their work-life balance as very
                good,
                compared to 38% of those who worked at the office but used daily flex time.

        <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
        <p>web developers essentially make a website work by building the functionality, interactivity and visible structure of the site, normally based on the vision of designers and other key roles.

            Web developers are also responsible for ensuring a site functions correctly on all browsers - both desktop and mobile - through testing. Once a site is live, a developer carries out  updates and other maintenance tasks as necessary.</p>
